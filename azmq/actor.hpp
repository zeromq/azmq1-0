    /** \brief create an actor bound to one end of a pipe (pair of inproc sockets)
     *  \param peer io_service to associate the peer (caller) end of the pipe
     *  \param f Function accepting socket& as the first parameter and a
     *           number of additional args
     *  \returns peer socket
     *
     *  \remark The newly created actor will run in a boost::thread, and will
     *  receive the 'server' end of the pipe as it's first argument.  The actor
     *  will be attached to the lifetime of the returned socket and will run
     *  until it is destroyed.
     *
     *  \remark Each actor has an associated io_service and the supplied socket
     *  will be created on this io_service. The actor may access this by calling
     *  get_io_service() on the supplied socket.
     *
     *  \remark The associated io_service is configured to stop the spawned actor
     *  on SIG_KILL and SIG_TERM.
     *
     *  \remark Termination:
     *      well behaved actors should ultimately call run() on the io_service
     *      associated with the supplied socket. This allows the 'client' end of
     *      the socket's lifetime to cleanly signal termination. If for some
     *      reason, this is not possible, the caller should set the 'detached'
     *      option on the 'client' socket. This detaches the actor's associated
     *      thread from the client socket so that it will not be joined at
     *      destruction time. It is then up to the caller to work out the termination
     *      signal for the background thread; for instance by sending a termination
     *      message.
     *
     *      Also note, the default signal handling for the background thread is
     *      designed to call stop() on the associated io_service, so not calling
     *      run() in your handler means you are responsible for catching these
     *      signals in some other way.
